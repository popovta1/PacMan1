Japanese version  Pacman game. Main character is ninja.
He can move by left, right, forward or backward direction and collect points.
Map is loading from file. It looks like a matrix of characters.
There are enemy room, ninja's start position, samurai's start positions and point's position.
Every samurai has unique moving algorithm
There are three modes for samurai(like in original pacman game)
I use SDL2 library and SDL_TTF library.
Polymorphism: overloading methods Move for Ninja,  collision Ninja and Grass or Ninja and Samurai
